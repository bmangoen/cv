    During these years at this engineering school, I learnt my main technical skills.

    Indeed, I had a lot of algorithm and programming courses in C the first year.
    Then, every programming courses were in Java like object oriented programming, concurrency or design patterns.
    I was lucky to have great profesors who are active contributors of the Java community. 
    They also taught us the importance of the open source.

    In addition to the technical skills, I developped a better way to organize the accumulation of work.
    I learnt to work more efficiently as a team during the projects.

    I also had the chance to do a full apprenticeship in IBM as a system administrator.

    I did a foreign semester for ERASMUS program at Politehnica University of Bucharest in the Computer Sciences department.
    I learnt a lot of technical skills thanks to the funny courses there, like game programming, big data or software systems.

    But it was first of all an important human experience by discovering a new country with an awesome different culture and meeting a lot of people coming from all over the world.

    After getting the high-school's diploma of science, I've decided to continue studying Mathematics more in detail.

    As a gamer since my childhood and a big Internet user, I also wanted to discover the "unknown" domain of computer science.
    Since this first course of algorithm, I've become passoniate about all computer science related subjects.

    During this bachelor degree, I learnt the basis of programming and got a big overview of IT topics.
