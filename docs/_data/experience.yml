    As a Cloud consultant, I realized a lot of projects for different customers.

    My first projects were mostly for installing Ansible Tower and writing Ansible playbooks.
    There were different use cases:
    - servers management (Linux and Windows)
    - network equipments management
    - application deployment

    I also worked on a complete Infrastructure as Code in cloud environment (GCP / Azure)

    As I had a lot of interest for container topics, I worked on many projects related to OpenShift.
    I did expertise missions by answering technical questions about OpenShift and containers world in general.
    I also worked on "Proof of Concept" in customer environment to show the benefits of this product.
    But since the general availability of OpenShift Container Platform 4, I realized important projects:
    - Installation and day-2 on private and hybrid environment (VMware and baremetal). 
      It was an enriching experience because the customer didn't have experience with containers 
      so I had to teach them from the concepts to the management of the platform and to the application deployment on it.
    - Automated deployment on Cloud environment. 
      I joined the customer team which is responsible of deploying and managing the orchestrated containers platforms (OpenShift).
      My main goals were to study and implement an automated way to install OpenShift 4 on Azure with a lot of customer specifications 
      as the private and offline installation, the using a non default SDN plugin (Calico), the integration with customer external services.
      I worked very closed to the customer SRE team for teaching them and getting their feedback.
